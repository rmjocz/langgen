example of finite automata description to be generated:

0.
  0 " " -
  0 "\n" ~ L_NL
  1 "\r"

1
  0 "\n" ~  L_NL
  0      ~@ L_NL

0.
  1 "\-"
  2 "."
  3 "0-9"

1
  2 "."
  3 "0-9"  

2
  4 "0-9"

3
  3 "0-9"
  4 "."
  0       @ DIG

4
  4 "0-9"
  0       @ DIG

explanation:

0.        dot option indicate stop node adding special end of file case escape

0         each lexeme start from node 0 which is global number
  1       link is pointing to node 1, note that this number is local


  0       @ DIG  option @ is default no advance of the tape legeme DIG is produced

1        
  0 "\n" ~  L_NL option  ~ is to indicate end of line to count properly row column position in the file
  0      ~@ L_NL such two options can be combined together

2
  3 "."    - single char link condition
  4 "0-9"  - set of chars feature of link condition

0.
  0 " " - it is option to clear the buffer of not needed
  0 "\n" ~ L_NL
  1 "\r"


numbers of nodes are local except node 0

-----
another simpler example
\n is new line char \r is carriage return
carriage return is optional here but both nodes 0 and 1 are necessary to make NL exeme

0.
  0 " " -
  0 "\n"  ~   NL
  1 "\r"
  2 "0-9"

1
  0 "\n"  ~   NL
  0       ~@  NL

2
  2 "0-9"
  0       @   DIG
