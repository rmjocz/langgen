Here is lexer generator it is very simple tool 
giving you full control of automata behaviour.
Source code is easy to understand and generated sources also are easily readable.
Lexer generator outputs code to console producing 3 classes
to run the lexer you don't need any additional third party libraries, 
or to write anything by hand.
However parser and its data structures you have to write by your own 
depending on your particular needs, here is a little examples in fragments of code
showing how to do it, but is is not comperhensive guide by any means.
                                                                                                                                
By using similar technique you can generate parser finite automatas as well.
If you need filtering the of lexemes codes in your parser you need to change final ints in Lexeme class to 2^n style (1 2 4 etc)  manually,
(then you can use & oprator to filter input).
